# Work-Planner
This webpage functions as a calendar app that can store events added to it by the user. Simply click into one of the text boxes with a corresponding time of your choice,
and type on what you have planned for that hour. The hours are from 9am to 5pm, fitting for employees that work a 9 to 5 job.

The hours are also colour coded:
>
>- Grey is for past hours.
>- Red is for the current hour.
>- Green is for future hours.

Whatever text you type in any given hour can be saved onto the client's local storage by clicking on the floopy disk icon. This text will not be lost if the page is closed or
refreshed, as any text that has been saved will appear in its respective hour.

## What was the motivation?
To test the skills I have learnt from studying jQuery, which involves studying the different notation that's used in jQuery compared to what I learned before, which was
JavaScript. Throughout the creation of this planner app, I've understood that jQuery is primarily used to simplifiy the amount of code needed to execute things.
